The &lt;a&gt; tag, also known as the <b>Anchor Tag,</b> is used for creating hyperlinks in HTML. We can use the a tag to create a link that can direct a user 
to any resource present on the www including, textual information, images, music files, video files and video clips, animation, etc.
<br><br>The a tag is a container tag, i.e., it has ON tag as &lt;a&gt; and an OFF tag as &lt;/a&gt; . It has two important attributes:
<br>
<ol>
	<li>The <b>name</b> attribute, which is used to create an <b>anchor point</b> in the HTML document.
	<li>The <b>href</b> attribute, which is used to create a reference point or hyperlink.
</ol>
<br><b>Creating Internal Links</b>
<br>To create an internal links:
<br><ol>
		<li>We should first identify the target section of the web page, and create an anchor point at it using the <b>name</b> attribute of the 'a' tag.
		<li>Then we should create a reference point or a hyperlink to the named section using <b>href</b> attribute of the 'a' tag, at an appropraite location on the web page.
</ol>
<br><b>Syntax : </b>&lt;a name = "Anchor name"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br>&lt;a href="Anchor name"&gt;Linking text point &lt;/a&gt
