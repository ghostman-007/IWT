html stand for <B>Hypertext Markup Language,</B> a language that is used for creating web pages.html is not a programming language. It is a layout specification
 language in which elements called <I>Tags </I>and their <I>Attributes</I> are used to markup (or specify) how the various types of contents such as text, 
 pictures, tables, audio, video, etc., will be displayed by a web
 browser.
 <p>The html documents have two basic components: contents (text, images, music and video clips,etc.) and <I>tags</I>. html documents can be created in any 
 simple text editor like Notepad and must have a .htm or .html file extension. Web Browser like the Internet Explorer or FireFox to read the html documents and
  display them as web pages.</p>

<b><center><h2>html Tags and Attributes</h2></center></b>
A Tag consists of a keyboard (and many times also the attributes) enclosed within a <i>left angled bracket (<)</i> and a <i>right angled bracket (>).</i> It is a 
formatting specification which tells a web browser how to display a particular content (text, picture, video, audio, etc.) it marks up.
<br>
The majority of tags have attributes. The attributesare the sub elements or features of the tags that give additional functionality to the tags, allowing a user
 to manipulate the marked up elements in different ways.

<b><center><h2>Types of Tags</h2></center></b>
The html tags can be classified into two main categories - <i>Container Tags </i>and <i>Empty Tags.</i>
<br><br><b>Container Tags:</b> Container Tags are used in pairs and have a starting tag (ON tag) and ending tag (OFF tag). These tags define how the contents contained within them 
should be formatted.
<br><b><i>Example:</i></b>To make a line of the text bold, we use the tags &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;;
<br>where &lt;b&gt; is the starting tag and &lt;/b&gt; is the ending tag and the ellipse (...) represent the text to be made bold.
<br><br><b>Empty Tags </b>have onlly a starting tag. They do not need to be followed by an ending tag. Empty tags are used for giving formatting constructs.
<br><b><i>Eample:</i></b>To insert a line break, we use the tag &lt;br&gt;. Just writing &lt;br&gt; after the required text tells the browser to start any text that follows from
the next line.
<br><br><br><b>REMEMBER : </b>Tags are not case sensitive. So &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; is the same as &lt;B&gt;...&lt/B&gt;, but the correct way is to type them in lower case.
